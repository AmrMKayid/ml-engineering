## Fit more into GPU memory

The more GPU memory you have for your batch size (BS) the more efficient the GPUs will be at performing compute, and the faster you will complete your task since you will be able to go through data faster.

Of course, this section is crucial for when you get GPU OOM with even BS=1 and you don't want to rent/buy more hardware.


## Anatomy of Model's Operations

Transformers architecture includes 3 main groups of operations grouped below by compute-intensity.

1. **Tensor Contractions**

    Linear layers and components of Multi-Head Attention all do batched **matrix-matrix multiplications**. These operations are the most compute-intensive part of training a transformer.

2. **Statistical Normalizations**

    Softmax and layer normalization are less compute-intensive than tensor contractions, and involve one or more **reduction operations**, the result of which is then applied via a map.

3. **Element-wise Operators**

    These are the remaining operators: **biases, dropout, activations, and residual connections**. These are the least compute-intensive operations.

This knowledge can be helpful to know when analyzing performance bottlenecks.

## Anatomy of Model's Memory

We've seen that training the model uses much more memory than just putting the model on the GPU. This is because there are many components during training that use GPU memory. The components on GPU memory are the following:

1. model weights
2. optimizer states
3. gradients
4. forward activations saved for gradient computation
5. temporary buffers
6. functionality-specific memory

A typical model trained in mixed precision with AdamW requires 18 bytes per model parameter plus activation memory and temp memory.

For inference there are no optimizer states and gradients, so we can subtract those. And thus we end up with 6 bytes per model parameter for mixed precision inference, plus activation memory.

Let's look at the details.

**Model Weights:**

- 4 bytes * number of parameters for fp32 training
- 6 bytes * number of parameters for mixed precision training (maintains a model in fp32 and one in fp16/bf16 in memory)

**Optimizer States:**

- 8 bytes * number of parameters for normal AdamW (maintains 2 states)
- 4 bytes * number of parameters for AdamW running at bf16. See [this work](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/21312) that uses `AnyPrecisionAdamW`.
- 4 bytes * number of parameters for optimizers like SGD with momentum (maintains only 1 state) or LION, or Adafactor (and others)
- 2 bytes * number of parameters for 8-bit AdamW optimizers like [bitsandbytes](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes)

**Gradients**

- 4 bytes * number of parameters for either fp32 or mixed precision training (gradients are almost always kept in fp32)

**Forward Activations**

- size depends on many factors, the key ones being sequence length, hidden size and batch size.

There are the input and output that are being passed and returned by the forward and the backward functions and the forward activations saved for gradient computation.

**Temporary Memory**

Additionally there are all kinds of temporary variables which get released once the calculation is done, but in the moment these could require additional memory and could push to OOM. Therefore when coding it's crucial to think strategically about such temporary variables and sometimes to explicitly free those as soon as they are no longer needed.

**Functionality-specific memory**

Then your software could have special memory needs. For example, when generating text using beam search, the software needs to maintain multiple copies of inputs and outputs.

**`forward` vs `backward` Execution Speed**

For convolutions and linear layers there are 2x flops in the backward compared to the forward, which generally translates into ~2x slower (sometimes more, because sizes in the backward tend to be more awkward). Activations are usually bandwidth-limited, and itâ€™s typical for an activation to have to read more data in the backward than in the forward (e.g. activation forward reads once, writes once, activation backward reads twice, gradOutput and output of the forward, and writes once, gradInput).

So there are potentially a few places where we could save GPU memory or speed up operations. Let's start with a simple optimization: choosing the right batch size.




## Batch sizes

One gets the most efficient performance when batch sizes and input/output neuron counts are divisible by a certain number, which typically starts at 8, but can be much higher as well. That number varies a lot depending on the specific hardware being used and the dtype of the model.

For example for fully connected layers (which correspond to GEMMs), NVIDIA provides recommendations for [input/output neuron counts](
https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/dl-performance-fully-connected/index.html#input-features) and [batch size](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/dl-performance-fully-connected/index.html#batch-size).

[Tensor Core Requirements](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/dl-performance-matrix-multiplication/index.html#requirements-tc) define the multiplier based on the dtype and the hardware. For example, for fp16 a multiple of 8 is recommended, but on A100 it's 64!

For parameters that are small, there is also [Dimension Quantization Effects](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/dl-performance-matrix-multiplication/index.html#dim-quantization) to consider, this is where tiling happens and the right multiplier can have a significant speedup.




## Gradient Accumulation

The idea behind gradient accumulation is to instead of calculating the gradients for the whole batch at once to do it in smaller steps. The way we do that is to calculate the gradients iteratively in smaller batches by doing a forward and backward pass through the model and accumulating the gradients in the process. When enough gradients are accumulated we run the model's optimization step. This way we can easily increase the overall batch size to numbers that would never fit into the GPU's memory. In turn, however, the added forward and backward passes can slow down the training a bit.

When doing Pipeline Parallelism gradient accumulation is a must since one tries to keep the bubble in the pipeline to be as small as possible which requires a large queues of micro-batches.

Since the optimizer step isn't performed as often with gradient accumulation there is an additional speed up here as well.

The following benchmarks demonstrate how increasing the gradient accumulation steps improves the overall throughput: [RTX-3090](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/14608#issuecomment-1004392537) and [A100](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/15026#issuecomment-1005033957).






### Gradient checkpointing

This is only relevant for training.

Enabling gradient checkpointing allows one to trade speed for memory. When this feature is activated instead of remembering the outputs of, say, transformer blocks until the backward pass is done, these outputs are dropped. This frees up huge amounts of GPU memory. But, of course, a backward pass is not possible without having the outputs of forward pass, and thus they have to be recalculated.

This, of course, can vary from model to model, but typically one pays with about 20-25% decrease in throughput, but since a huge amount of gpu memory is liberated, one can now increase the batch size per gpu and thus overall improve the effective throughput of the system. In some cases this allows you to double or quadruple the batch size if you were already able to do a small batch size w/o OOM.

Activation checkpointing and gradient checkpointing are 2 terms for the same methodology.

For example, in HF Transformers models you do `model.gradient_checkpointing_enable()` to activate it in your trainer or if you HF Trainer then you'd activate it with `--gradient_checkpointing 1`.


### Memory-efficient optimizers

The most common optimizer is Adam. It and its derivatives all use 8 bytes per param (2 fp32 tensors - one for each momentum), which account for almost half the memory allocation for the model, optimizer and gradients. So at times using other optimizers may save the day, if they successfully train that is. Not all optimizers are suitable for all training tasks.

4-byte optimizers:

- There are optimizers like Adafactor that need only 4 bytes. Same goes for the recently invented [LION optimizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06675).

- `AnyPrecisionAdamW`. Some courageous souls try to do the whole training in BF16 (not mixed precision!), including the optimizer and thus need only 4 bytes per parameter for optim states. See [this work](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/21312). Hint: this optimizer requires Kahan summation and/or stochastic rounding, see [Revisiting BFloat16 Training (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06192). You need only 8 bytes per parameter for weights, optim states and gradients here! Instead of 18!

2-byte optimizers:

- There are quantized solutions like `bnb.optim.Adam8bit` which uses only 2 bytes instead of 8 (1 byte per momentum).  You can get it from [here](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes). Once installed, if you're using HF Trainer, you can enable it on with just passing `--optim adamw_bnb_8bit`!

For speed comparisons see [this benchmark](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/22101)
Speed-wise:`apex`'s Adam optimizer is so far the fastest implementation of Adam.
