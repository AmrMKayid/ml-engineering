- [pt-checkpoint-shrink.py](./pt-checkpoint-shrink.py) - this script fixes checkpoints which for some reason stored tensors with storage larger than their view at the moment of saving. It clones the current view and re-saves them with just the storage of the current view.

- [multi-gpu-non-interleaved-print.py](./multi-gpu-non-interleaved-print.py) - a `flock`-based wrapper around `print` that prevents messages from getting interleaved when multiple processes print at the same time - which is the case with `torch.distributed` used with multiple-gpus.
