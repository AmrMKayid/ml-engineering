# Machine Learning Engineering Guides and Tools

An open collection of methodologies to help with successful training of large language models and multi-modal models.

This is technical material suitable for LLM/VLM training engineers and operators. That is the content here contains lots of scripts and copy-n-paste commands to enable you to quickly address your needs.

This repo is to a brain dump of my experiences training Large Language Models (LLM). e.g., a lot of the know-how I acquired while training the open-source [BLOOM-176B](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom) model in 2022 and
[IDEFICS-80B](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceM4/idefics-80b-instruct) model in 2023. Currently, I'm working on developing/training a open-source Retrieval model at [Contextual.AI](https://contextual.ai/).
